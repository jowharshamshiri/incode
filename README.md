# InLLDB - Intelligent LLDB Debugging Automation

**Version**: 0.1.0  
**Type**: MCP Server for AI-Powered LLDB Debugging  
**Scope**: 65+ debugging tools across 13 categories

## Overview

InLLDB is a comprehensive Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI agents with complete LLDB debugging capabilities. Inspired by [insite's](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/insite) comprehensive browser automation (52 tools across 13 categories), InLLDB delivers the same breadth of coverage for LLDB debugging automation.

Just as insite allows agents to see into browsers - taking screenshots, monitoring network activity, executing JavaScript - InLLDB allows agents to see into native binary execution via LLDB debugging with comprehensive process control, memory inspection, and program analysis.

## Architecture

- **Language**: Rust (performance, safety, memory management)
- **LLDB Integration**: lldb-sys crate for direct C++ API access
- **Protocol**: Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI agent communication
- **Design**: Feature-centric development with 65+ tools organized by category

cd inlldb
cargo build --release

# Run the MCP server
./target/release/inlldb
```

### MCP Client Configuration

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "inlldb": {
      "command": "/path/to/inlldb/target/release/inlldb",
      "args": ["--debug"],
      "env": {
        "LLDB_PATH": "/usr/bin/lldb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Process Debugging

```json
[
  {
    "name": "launch_process",
    "arguments": {
      "executable": "./my_program",
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
      "env": {"DEBUG": "1"}
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "set_breakpoint", 
    "arguments": {
      "location": "main.cpp:42"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "continue_execution"
  }
]
```

### Memory Analysis Workflow

```json
[
  {
    "name": "read_memory",
    "arguments": {
      "address": "0x7fff12345000",
      "size": 256,
      "format": "hex"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "search_memory",
    "arguments": {
      "pattern": "deadbeef",
      "start_address": "0x7fff00000000",
      "size": "0x100000"
    }
  }
]
```

### Advanced Analysis

```json
[
  {
    "name": "get_backtrace"
  },
  {
    "name": "evaluate_expression",
    "arguments": {
      "expression": "*(struct my_data*)0x12345"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "analyze_crash",
    "arguments": {
